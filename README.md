# Testing
You will get a far more interactive test interface by running 
```
docker exec -it xxxxxx sh
```
where xxxxxx is the container id or name gained from `docker ps`Using the docker-compose.yml to setup a seperate test service does not 
provide the interactivity or concurrency with the code base.
